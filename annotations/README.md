# Annotations

## Description:

Manual annotations of measure positions for at least one reference recording per composer-composition-movement. In our analysis, we use .txt files
and treat their indexes as measure positions, which is not always the case. For example, some compositions do not start with a downbeat; therefore, the first value
should technically correspond to, e.g., 0.5 measure.
