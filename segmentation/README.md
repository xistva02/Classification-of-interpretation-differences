## Description:

Format of files: motifs_<user>_<session>_mov<movement>.txt

Each file consists of number of motifs from given composer, composition, and movement defined by sheet music. Numbers correspond to the measures; e.g., in
'motifs_Dvorak_No.12_mov1.txt' file, the first motif is given by 1–16 measure, the second by 17–25, etc. Keep in mind that we do not respect repetitions 
and use 'disentangled' sheet music.
