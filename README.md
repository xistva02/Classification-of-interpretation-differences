## Description:

Some of the functions are hand-crafted for specific data and their labels. The recordings are divided into categories: 'user' (composer), 'session' (composition), 'movement'. 
Another important parameters are 'labels' ('label_CZ' denoting Czech or non-Czech origin and 'label_random' with random distribution) and 'scenarios' ('movements', 'motifs', and 'measures'). For better description and more details, see the paper.
