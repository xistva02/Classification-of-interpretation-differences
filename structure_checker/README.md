# Structure checker

## Description:
The script **structure_checker.py** provides a function to detect different music structures (such as repetitions). It uses calculation of slope of the warping path with
hand-crafted threshold values. It is probably not the best option, e.g. see: "Christian Fremerey, Meinard Müller, and Michael Clausen: Handling Repeats and Jumps in Score-Performance Synchronization. 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR): 243–248, 2010" and "Improved handling of repeats and jumps in audio-sheet image synchronization
